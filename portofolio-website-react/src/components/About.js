        <p>Hello, my name is Muhammad Sinan Abdussyakur. I'm an undergraduate computer science major at Bina Nusantara University, as I've already mentioned before. I've learned a lot about many programming fundamentals over my two years in college. I've had exposure to a wide range of topics, including Code Reengineering, Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Networks, and many more. <br /><br />I've had the chance to work with various programming language, such as, C, Java, PHP, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, and JS. These experiences have given me the opportunity to hone a broad range of skills. <br /><br />In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy watching movies, playing video games, listening to music, and dabbling with street photography, as I can express my creativity via these activities, and they also help me relax after a hard day of studying.</p>
